# Devoops Project Report

This report details our project done February to May in 2020 during the course "DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance" at IT University of Copenhagen.

Project team members:

The intent of the course was to learn how to maintain and evolve a legacy system. 
For this purpose a legacy twitter clone, implemented in Flask with Python 2, was given to the group and the task with refactoring the application to be more modern. 

This report consists for three parts, a description of the system in it's final state when course ended, an explanation of the development process & tools used and finally it contains the lessons learned while developing the system.
