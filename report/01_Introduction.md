# Devoops Project Report

This report details our project done February to May in 2020 during the course "DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance" at IT University of Copenhagen.

The team members were:
- Hjalte Sorgenfrei Mac Dalland, hjda@itu.dk
- Jakob Isrealsen, jais@itu.dk
- Jonas Lindenskov Nielsen, joln@itu.dk
- Tobias LÃ¸fgren, tobl@itu.dk
- Simon Green Kristensen, sigk@itu.dk

The intent of the course was to learn how to maintain and evolve a legacy system. 
For this purpose a legacy twitter clone, implemented in Flask with Python 2, was given to our group and we were tasked with refactoring the application to be more modern. 

This report consists for three parts, a description of the system in it's final state when course ended, an explanation of the development process and tools used herein. Finally it contains the lessons we learned developing the system.
