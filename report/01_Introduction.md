# Devoops Project Report

This document is the final report of Group D(evOops) for course "DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance" at the IT University of Copenhagen. The report covers a project done in the period of February to May of 2020 by the following members:
- Hjalte Sorgenfrei Mac Dalland, hjda@itu.dk
- Jakob Isrealsen, jais@itu.dk
- Jonas Lindenskov Nielsen, joln@itu.dk
- Tobias LÃ¸fgren, tobl@itu.dk
- Simon Green Kristensen, sigk@itu.dk

The intent of the course was to learn how to maintain and evolve a legacy system. 
For this purpose a legacy twitter clone, implemented in Flask with Python 2 running on a old MacOS version, was given to the group along with the task of refactoring the application. 
It was to run on a modern operating system, Ubuntu 18.04, and not use outdated and unsupported technologies. To facilitate a smoother development and minimize lead time, DevOps practices like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) were to be utilized. In addition to CI/CD extensive logging and monitoring were to be employed to aid in spotting and fixing problems. 

This report consists for three parts, a description of the system in its final state when course ended, an explanation of the development process & tools used and finally it contains the lessons learned while developing the system.
