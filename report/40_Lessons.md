## Lessons Learned

The project would have been for nothing if the team didn't learn anything trying to refactor and maintain the project.
Trying to implement changes and follow standards is bound to cause problems, and from solving these problems, learning is obtained.

This section is dedicated to explaining what learning the team has made.
It sets out to document the learning itself, as well as the concrete situations where it was obtained, along with reflections on the process.
