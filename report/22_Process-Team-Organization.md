The team has organized itself mainly through a weekly meeting after the lecture in which tasks were distributed. The team has not found any formalized process corresponding to this, but it has had several advantages and drawbacks.

On the positive side, this method has very little overhead, and requires little scheduling since the main activity is done in continuation of a mandatory activity for which members are supposed to be present. It also leaves more time for actual development work. 

The method does, however, suffer a few problems. It does not involve any dedicated time for working, which makes it harder to schedule activities like pair programming, which has been done a few times throughout the course. There is no mechanic to ensure that more overreaching goals are reached, which by coincidence was not a major problem in this course. This is likely due to the fact that the team managed to get through quite a few tasks in the first few weeks, and could thus keep up with the scheduled tasks.
