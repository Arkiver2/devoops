The team was organized mainly through a weekly meeting after the lecture in which tasks were distributed. It was discussed what tasks needed to be done, and then people assigned themselves to tasks until every task had a developer assigned. The tasks and assigned developers were tracked using GitHub Issues.

The process had some advantages. Amongst these were that the method has very little overhead, and requires little scheduling since the main team activity, requiring the whole team, is done in continuation of a mandatory activity for which members are supposed to be present. It, therefore, leaves more time for actual development work when compared to something like SCRUM. Another advantage is that work is done when the developer has the time to work on it, and is, therefore, easier to fit into a busy schedule.

But there are some drawbacks to the process. It does not involve any dedicated time for working, which makes it harder to schedule activities like pair programming, which has been only been done a few times throughout the course. There are potentially also some social problems with this method in case some developers are shy about assigning themselves tasks they would like to do, but that was not an issue during this project. While not directly a drawback, this method does not have any scheduled knowledge sharing so it is the responsibility of each developer to familiarize themselves with changes to the codebase.
