The team has organized itself mainly through a weekly meeting after the lecture in which tasks were distributed. It was discussed what tasks needed to be done, and then people assigned themselves to tasks until every task had a developer assigned. The tasks and assigned developers were tracked using GitHub Issues. The above method does not correspond to any formalized process, but it has had several advantages and drawbacks. 

On the positive side, the method has very little overhead, and requires little scheduling since the main activity is done in continuation of a mandatory activity for which members are supposed to be present. It also leaves more time for actual development work. 

The method does, however, suffer a few problems. It does not involve any dedicated time for working, which makes it harder to schedule activities like pair programming, which has been done a few times throughout the course. There are potentially also some social problems with this method, if some developers are shy about assigning themselves tasks they would like to do, but the for this specific team, this was not a problem as the developers had known each other for a while.
