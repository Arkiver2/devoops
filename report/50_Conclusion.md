## Conclusion

During the course of this project, the group has taken the legacy version of the MiniTwit application and refactored it into a modern ASP.NET application, which has made the application much more maintainable. Furthermore, several tools and techniques have been used to further enhance the project according to DevOps principles. This has benefitted the systems in many ways, as laid out in this report, and ultimately led to a more robust and transparent system with decreased lead times for new features.

While working on the project it has become clear that while adopting a DevOps mindset is a lot of work, it also carries great benefits.
If the techniques discussed in this report were utilized more broadly in the industry, both for web development projects and otherwise, being a developer would likely be a less stressful job.
However, it is also important for each team to consider what parts will provide the most value, as there is famously no silver bullet and because each DevOps practice can require a significant time effort for it to be implemented properly.
This is especially true when considering adding new technology to a project, as buzzwords and hype can often blind developers into grabbing a solution and then go looking for a problem.
That is, developers should not focus too much on specific tools, but rather follow the general philosophy of DevOps.

In conclusion, learning about and then implementing DevOps practices in a project has been immensely valuable. Having gained a firmer grip on the technical aspects, the team is now ready to tackle larger challenges, like changing culture and organizing projects, by taking full advantage of the DevOps mindset.
